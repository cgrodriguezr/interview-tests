# Java Interview Exercise — Aeroplane Passenger Management

This is a take-home coding exercise. Your task is to implement the logic in two classes so that all tests pass.

**There is no pressure to set up a full development environment.** If you would rather read the code and write pseudocode or plain English explanations of your approach, that is completely fine — we are interested in how you think, not whether you can configure a Java toolchain. Do as much or as little as you are comfortable with.

## What the exercise involves

The code models a simple aeroplane passenger system. Two classes need implementing:

- `Aeroplane` — manages a list of passengers on the plane (adding, removing, querying)
- `PassengerService` — utility methods for filtering, sorting, and calculating costs

Each unimplemented method has a description of what it should do. The tests in `AeroplaneTest.java` show exactly what inputs and outputs are expected.

You are not expected to modify the tests or add new files.

## What we are looking for

- **How you approach a problem** — breaking it down, identifying edge cases, reasoning through the logic
- **Not** perfect Java syntax, optimal algorithms, or a complete solution — partial answers are fine

## Option A — No setup required

Just open the two files directly and write your solution as code, pseudocode, or comments:

- `src/main/java/org/example/model/Aeroplane.java`
- `src/main/java/org/example/model/PassengerService.java`

Pseudocode in any language or style is welcome — Python, JavaScript, plain English, whatever you think in. For example:

```java
public int countPassengers() {
    // return the size of the passengers list
}
```

```python
def count_passengers():
    # Python-style if that's more natural:
    return len(passengers)
```

That is enough for us to understand your thinking.

## Option B — Run the tests locally

If you already have Java 17 and Maven set up, or are happy to install them yourself, you can run the tests to verify your implementation:

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn clean test

# Run a single test
mvn test -Dtest=AeroplaneTest#shouldAddPassengerOnEnter
```
